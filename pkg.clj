;;  Clojure package loading and dependency via require/provide.
;;
;;  A 'package' is a named set of capabilities represented by a symbol.
;;  Its capabilities are expected to be defined in an implementation
;;  file somewhere in CLASSPATH whose name is the package name followed
;;  by ".clj".  The implementation file may be in the filesystem, in a
;;  jar file, or at any other valid CLASSPATH URL.
;;
;;  A call to 'require' indicates that subsequent code depends on
;;  capabilities provided by one or more packages and loads any of those
;;  packages that have not already been provided.
;;
;;  A call to 'provide' indicates that a package's capabilities have been
;;  successfully loaded.  A package's implementation file will generally
;;  end with a call to provide.
;;
;;  pkg.clj provides variations of 'require' that:
;;
;;    - require a package and automatically 'refer' to a namespace of the
;;      same name.  This is for the common case of a package defining its
;;      own namespace which dependent code wants to use without namespace
;;      qualifiers. 'require-ns'
;;
;;    - force the loading of all packages and dependencies regardless of
;;      whether they have already been provided. 'require-force'
;;
;;    - both refer to the package's namespace and force a reload of the
;;      the package and its dependencies. 'require-ns-force'
;;
;;  The "force" variations are useful during development.
;;
;;  'provide' is made available as a separate function (in addition to
;;  being done automatically after loading an implementation file) to allow
;;  flexibility in providing a package's capabilities by some means other
;;  than loading an implementation file using 'require'.
