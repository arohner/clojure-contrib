;; This file defines "duck-typed" I/O utility functions for Clojure.
;; The 'reader' and 'writer' functions will open and return an
;; instance of java.io.BufferedReader and java.io.PrintWriter,
;; respectively, for a variety of argument types -- filenames as
;; strings, URLs, java.io.File's, etc.  These functions are not very
;; efficient, because they have to perform a number of 'instance?'
;; checks, but they are convenient when you just want to open a file
;; and don't want to deal with all the Java I/O classes.
;;
;; This file also defines two convenience functions, 'spit' (opposite
;; of 'slurp') and 'write-lines' (opposite of 'line-seq').
