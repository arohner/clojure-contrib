 ;; Examples

 ;; Simple tests of sql.clj using sqlite as a JDBC provider.  Note that
 ;; unlike sql.clj itself, these tests require that java be able to
 ;; access sqlite via something like: http://zentus.com/sqlitejdbc .
 ;;
 ;; Substituting a different database should only affect the definition
 ;; of 'db' below (and perhaps suggest the need for more variations of
 ;; get-connection).
