;;  jewel.clj
;;
;;  A 'jewel' is a Clojure source file that follows these conventions:
;;
;;    - has a basename that is a valid symbol name in Clojure,
;;    - has the extension ".clj", and
;;    - defines a namespace that has the same name as the basename.
;;
;;  A jewel will typically also contain forms that provide something useful
;;  for a Clojure program to use.
;;
;;  This file is an example of a jewel. It follows the naming conventions
;;  and provides two functions that make it convenient to use jewels from
;;  Clojure source code and the Clojure repl:
;;
;;  'jewel/require' takes a symbol representing a jewel and zero or more
;;  optional keyword parameters.
;;  jewel/require:
;;    - ensures that the jewel is either already loaded or loads it from
;;      within classpath. Optionally, the caller may specify a path to
;;      the jewel's parent directory relative to a location in classpath;
;;    - refers to the jewel's namespace. Optionally, the caller may
;;      specify any filters documented for clojure/refer as options to
;;      jewel/require;
;;    - optionally forces a (re)load of either just the jewel itself or of
;;      the jewel and all of the jewels on which it (directly or indirectly)
;;      depends;
;;    - optionally prints a message each time it loads a jewel.
;;
;;  'jewel/jewels' returns a sorted list of loaded jewels.
