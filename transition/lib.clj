;;  Libs
;;
;;  A 'lib' is a named set of resources in classpath whose contents define
;;  a library of Clojure code. Lib names are symbols and each lib is
;;  associated with the Clojure namespace and the Java package that share
;;  its name. A lib's name also locates its root directory within classpath
;;  using Java's package name to classpath-relative path mapping. All
;;  resources in a lib should be contained in the directory structure under
;;  its root directory. All definitions the lib makes should be in the
;;  lib's namespace.
;;
;;  Clojure loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource
;;  path is derived from the root directory path by repeating its last
;;  component and appending '.clj'. For example, the lib 'x.y.z has root
;;  directory <classpath>/x/y/z'; root resource '<classpath>/x/y/z/z.clj.
;;  The root resource should contain code to create the lib's namespace and
;;  load any additional lib resources.
;;
;;  Clojure provides functions to:
;;
;;    - ensure libs are loaded while avoiding duplicate loads (require)
;;    - require libs and refer to their namespaces (use)
;;    - return a sorted set of symbols naming loaded libs (loaded-libs)
;;    - load Clojure code from resources (load-resources)
;;
;;  Libspecs
;;
;;  A libspec identifies a lib to load. It's either a lib name or a vector
;;  containing a lib name followed by options expressed as squential
;;  keywords and arguments. Libspec examples:
;;
;;    - 'clojure.contrib.sql
;;    - '[clojure.contrib.sql :exclude (get-connection) :as sql]
;;
;;  Prefix Lists
;;
;;  It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names have
;;  the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be used to
;;  reduce repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix followed by
;;  libspecs with the shared prefix removed from the lib names. After
;;  removing the prefix, the names that remain must not contain any
;;  periods. For example, the following are equivalent:
;;
;;    - (require 'clojure.contrib.def '[clojure.contrib.sql :as db])
;;    - (require '(clojure.contrib def [sql :as db]))
;;
;;  Examples
;;
;;    (require '(clojure.contrib sql sql.tests))
;;    (use '(clojure.contrib sql ns-utils) :verbose)
;;
;;    (use :reload-all :verbose
;;      '(clojure.contrib
;;        [sql :exclude (get-connection)
;;             :rename {execute-commands do-commands}]
;;        [ns-utils :as nsu]))

(defn require

  Libs

  A 'lib' is a named set of resources in classpath whose contents define a
  library of Clojure code. Lib names are symbols and each lib is associated
  with the Clojure namespace and the Java package that share its name. A
  lib's name also locates its root directory within classpath using Java's
  package name to classpath-relative path mapping. All resources in a lib
  should be contained in the directory structure under its root
  directory. All definitions the lib makes should be in the lib's
  namespace.

  'require loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource path
  is derived from the root directory path by repeating its last component
  and appending '.clj'. For example, the lib 'x.y.z has root directory
  <classpath>/x/y/z'; root resource '<classpath>/x/y/z/z.clj. The root
  resource should contain code to create the lib's namespace and load any
  additional lib resources.

  Libspecs

  A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed by
  options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments.

  Recognized options: :as
  :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias to the
    lib's namespace in the current namespace.

  Prefix Lists

  It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names have
  the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be used to reduce
  repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix followed by libspecs
  with the shared prefix removed from the lib names. After removing the
  prefix, the names that remain must not contain any periods.

  Flags

  A flag is a keyword.
  Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose
  :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are
    already loaded
  :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the
    identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use
  :verbose triggers printing information about calls to load-resources,
    alias, and refer"
  [& args]
  (apply load-libs :require args))

(defn use
  "Like 'require, but also refers to each lib's namespace using
  clojure/refer.

  'use accepts additional options in libspecs: :exclude, :only, :rename.
  The arguments and semantics for :exclude, :only, and :rename are the same
  as those documented for clojure/refer."
