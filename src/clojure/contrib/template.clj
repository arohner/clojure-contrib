;; CHANGE LOG
;;
;; January 20, 2009: added "template?" and checks for valid template
;; expressions.
;;
;; December 15, 2008: first version


;; DOCUMENTATION
;;
;; This file defines macros for using template expressions.  These are
;; useful for writing macros.
;;
;; A template is an expression containing "holes" represented by the
;; symbols _1, _2, _3, and so on.  ("_" is a synonym for "_1".)
;;
;; The "template" macro is similar to #().  It returns an anonymous
;; function containing the body of the template.  Unlike #() or "fn",
;; however, any expressions that do not have any holes will be
;; evaluated only once, at the time the function is created, not every
;; time the function is called.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
(comment
  ;; Assume we have some big, slow calculation.
  (defn think-hard []
    (Thread/sleep 1000)
    1000)

  ;; With #(), think-hard gets called every time.
  (time (doall (map #(+ % (think-hard))
                    (range 5))))
  ;;=> "Elapsed time: 5001.33455 msecs"
  ;;=> (1000 1001 1002 1003 1004)

  ;; With a template, think-hard only gets called once.
  (time (doall (map (template (+ _ (think-hard)))
                    (range 5))))
  ;;=> "Elapsed time: 1000.907326 msecs"
  ;;=> (1000 1001 1002 1003 1004)
)
;;
;;
;; There is also the do-template macro, which works differently.  It
;; calls the same template multiple times, filling in values, and puts
;; it all inside a "do" block.  It will split up the values based on
;; the number of holes in the template.
(comment
  (do-template (foo _1 _2) :a :b :c :d)
  ;; expands to: (do (foo :a :b) (foo :c :d))

  (do-template (foo _1 _2 _3) 10 11 12 13 14 15)
  ;; expands to: (foo 10 11 12) (foo 13 14 15)
