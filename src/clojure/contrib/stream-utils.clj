;; Stream transformers

; Going from a stream through an iter to another stream requires at
; one point to wrap the iter in a function that provides the generator
; interface. Life would be easier if iterators were callable and thus
; usable directly as generators! This function (1) creates an iter on
; its stream argument and (2) wraps that iter into a function with a
; generator interface.
(defn iter-as-generator [s]
  "Return a generator that returns items obtained from an iterator on s"
  (let [iter (stream-iter s)]
    (fn [eos] (next! iter eos))))

(defn drop-first
  "Return a stream that returns the elements of s except for the first n ones."
  [n s]
  (let [eos (Object.)
	gen (iter-as-generator s)]
    (doseq [_ (range n)] (gen eos))
    (stream gen)))

;; Monadic stream transformers

; Generator monad
;
; This monad represents computations with generators, as defined for
; Clojure streams: a function of one argument, an end-of-stream value,
; that returns at each call the "next" value of the stream, until the
; end of the stream is reached, and from then on it returns the supplied
; eos value forever. This monad permits the simple composition of such
; generators.
;
; The use of generators instead of streams as the basis of this monad
; has two reasons:
; 1) It is not possible to pass around a stream such that each
;    monadic computation step takes one item of it, because there can
;    be only one iterator per stream.
; 2) One could use iterators instead of generators as the monadic
;    values, even with minimal changes, but each computational step
;    in the monad would then create a new stream and a new iter,
;    adding overhead for no apparent benefit.

(defmonad generator
   "Monad describing stream-transforming computations. The monadic
    values are generator functions."
   [m-result (fn m-result-generator [v]
	       (fn [eos] v))
    m-bind   (fn m-bind-generator [mv f]
               (fn [eos]
		 (let [v (mv eos)]
		   (if (identical? v eos)
		     eos
		     ((f v) eos)))))
    ])

; A macro for defining stream transformers using the generator monad.
; It wraps the input streams into iters-that-look-like-generators,
; and converts the resulting generator into a stream.
(defmacro stream-transformer
  [stream-args & body]
  `(stream (let [~stream-args (map iter-as-generator ~stream-args)]
	     (with-monad generator ~@body))))


; Derive a variant of the generator monad that permits the
; use of :when conditions. Invalid values in the output are
; represented by ::skip, which is filtered out in the end
; by applying remove-skip. The macro stream-transformer-cond
; takes care of all these administrative details.

;; Some examples of monadic stream transformers

   elements of the input stream s."
  (stream-transformer [s]
    (m-seq (replicate n s))))

; Map a function on streams.
; Map has to be defined by an explicit expression for every number of
; arguments because the m-lift macro requires a constant as its first
; argument.
(defn map-s
  "Return a stream of the results of applying f on one item of each
   input sequence."
  ([f s]
   (stream-transformer [s]

  "Return a stream consisting of the elements of s that satisfy predicate p."
