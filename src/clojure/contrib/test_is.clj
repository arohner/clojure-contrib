;; Inspired by many Common Lisp test frameworks and clojure/test, this
;; file is a Clojure test framework.
;;
;; Define tests as :test metadata on your fns.  Use the "is" macro
;; for assertions.  Examples:
;;
;;     (defn add2
;;       ([x] (+ x 2))
;;       {:test (fn [] (is (= (add2 3) 5))
;;                     (is (= (add2 -4) -2)
;;                     (is (> (add2 50) 50))))})
;;
;; You can also define tests in isolation with the "deftest" macro:
;;
;;     (deftest test-new-fn
;;       (is (= (new-fn) "Awesome")))
;;
;; You can test that a function throws an exception with the
;; "is thrown?" form:
;;
;;     (defn factorial
;;       ([n] (cond
;;             (zero? n) 1  ; 0!=1 is often defined for convenience
;;             (> n 0) (* n (factorial (dec n)))
;;             :else (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Negative factorial"))))
;;       {:test (fn [] (is (= (factorial 3) 6))
;;                     (is (= (factorial 6) 720))
;;                     (is (thrown? IllegalArgumentException (factorial -2))))}) 
;;
;; Run tests with (run-tests). As in any language with macros, you may
;; need to recompile functions after changing a macro definition.

;;; REPORTING METHODS

;; These are used in assert-expr methods.  Rebind "report" to plug in
;; your own test-reporting framework.

(defn report-count
  "Increments the named counter in *report-counters*."

;;; ASSERTION METHODS

;; You don't call these, but you can add methods to extend the 'is'
;; macro.  These define different kinds of tests, based on the first
;; symbol in the test expression.

(defmulti assert-expr 
  (fn [msg form]
    (cond
     (nil? form) :always-fail
     (seq? form) (first form)
     :else :default)))

(defmethod assert-expr :default [msg form]
  ;; Default test: evaluate the form (which may be a bare symbol), and
  ;; pass if it is logical true.
  `(let [value# ~form]
     (if value#
       (report :pass ~msg '~form value#)
       (report :fail ~msg '~form value#))
     value#))

(defmethod assert-expr :always-fail [msg form]
  ;; nil test: always fail
  `(report :fail ~msg nil nil))

(defmethod assert-expr '= [msg form]
  ;; Equality test.  Doesn't care about argument order: 
  ;; (is (= expected actual))  or  (is (= actual expected))
  `(let [values# (list ~@(rest form))]
     (let [result# (apply = values#)]
       (if result#
         (report :pass ~msg '~form (cons '~'= values#))
         (report :fail ~msg '~form (cons '~'not= values#)))

(defmethod assert-expr 'instance? [msg form]
  ;; Test if x is an instance of y.
  `(let [klass# ~(nth form 1)
         object# ~(nth form 2)]
     (let [result# (instance? klass# object#)]
       (if result#
         (report :pass ~msg '~form (class object#))
         (report :fail ~msg '~form (class object#)))
       result#)))

(defmethod assert-expr 'thrown? [msg form]
  ;; (is (thrown? c expr))
  ;; Asserts that evaluating expr throws an exception of class c.
  ;; Returns the exception thrown.
  (let [klass (second form)
        body (rrest form)]
    `(try ~@body
          (report :fail ~msg '~form nil)
          (catch ~klass e#
            (report :pass ~msg '~form e#)
            e#))))

;; New assertions coming soon:
;; * thrown-with-msg?
;; * re-matches


;;; CATCHING UNEXPECTED EXCEPTIONS

(defmacro try-expr
  "Used by the 'is' macro to catch unexpected exceptions.
  You don't call this."
  [msg form]
  `(try ~(assert-expr msg form)
        (catch Throwable t#
          (report :error ~msg '~form t#))))



;;; ASSERTION MACROS

;; you use these in your tests

(defmacro is
  "Generic assertion macro.  'form' is any predicate test.
  'msg' is an optional message to attach to the assertion.
  
  Example: (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)) \"Two plus two should be 4\")

  Special form (is (thrown? c body)) checks that an instance of c is
  thrown from body, fails if not; then returns the thing thrown."
  ([form] `(is ~form nil))
  ([form msg] `(try-expr ~msg ~form)))

(defmacro are
  "Checks multiple assertions with the same predicate.
  Expands to (is (pred p1 p2)) for each pair.

  Example: (are = 2 (+ 1 1), 4 (+ 2 2))"
  [pred & pairs]
  `(do ~@(map (fn [pair] (list 'is (cons pred pair)))
              (partition 2 pairs))))
