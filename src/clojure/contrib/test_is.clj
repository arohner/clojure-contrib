;; Inspired by many Common Lisp test frameworks and clojure/test, this
;; file is a Clojure test framework.
;;
;; Define tests as :test metadata on your fns.  Use the "is" macro
;; for assertions.  Examples:
;;
;;     (defn add2
;;       ([x] (+ x 2))
;;       {:test (fn [] (is (= (add2 3) 5))
;;                     (is (= (add2 -4) -2)
;;                     (is (> (add2 50) 50))))})
;;
;; You can also define tests in isolation with the "deftest" macro:
;;
;;     (deftest test-new-fn
;;       (is (= (new-fn) "Awesome")))
;;
;; You can test that a function throws an exception with the
;; "is thrown?" form:
;;
;;     (defn factorial
;;       ([n] (cond
;;             (zero? n) 1  ; 0!=1 is often defined for convenience
;;             (> n 0) (* n (factorial (dec n)))
;;             :else (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Negative factorial"))))
;;       {:test (fn [] (is (= (factorial 3) 6))
;;                     (is (= (factorial 6) 720))
;;                     (is (thrown? IllegalArgumentException (factorial -2))))}) 
;;
;; Run tests with (run-tests). As in any language with macros, you may
;; need to recompile functions after changing a macro definition.
;;
;; If you want write a bunch of tests with the same predicate, use
;; "are", which takes a template and applies it inside "is".
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;;     (deftest test-addition
;;       (are (= _1 _2)
;;            3 (+ 2 1)
;;            4 (+ 2 2)
;;            5 (+ 4 1)))
;;
;;     (deftest test-predicates
;;       (are _  ; the template is just an underscore
;;            (true? true)
;;            (false? false)
;;            (nil? nil)))

;;; ASSERTION METHODS

;; You don't call these, but you can add methods to extend the 'is'
;; macro.  These define different kinds of tests, based on the first
;; symbol in the test expression.

;; you use these in your tests

  thrown from body, fails if not; then returns the thing thrown."
