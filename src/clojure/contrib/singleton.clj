(ns singleton)

(defn singleton
  "Returns a memoized version of a function with no arguments.  The
  memoized version caches the function's return value.

  This is useful for lazily creating global objects that are expensive
  to initialize.  Warning: Make sure you really want a single global
  instance, and not one instance per thread."
