;; This is superficially similar to Ken Tilton's "Cells" library for
;; Common Lisp.  But Cells is single-threaded and synchronous.  This
;; version is built on Clojure agents, so it is multi-threaded and
;; asynchronous.
;;
;; An auto-agent is an agent whose value is the result of an
;; expression.  That expression can include other mutable Clojure
;; types -- agents, atoms, and refs -- dereferenced with "deref" or
;; "@".  Whenever one of those derefernced things changes, the
;; auto-agent will be automatically updated to reflect the new value.
