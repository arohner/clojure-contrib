(defn miglayout
  "Adds java.awt.Components to a java.awt.Container with constraints
  formatted for the MiGLayout layout manager.

  Arguments: container [item constraint*]*

    - container: the container for the specified components, its layout
      manager will be set to a new instance of MigLayout

    - an inline series of items and constraints--each item may be followed
      by zero or more constraints.

  Item:

    - An item is either a Component or one of the keywords :layout
     :column or :row. Constraints for a keyword item affect the entire
      layout.

  Constraint: string, keyword, vector, or map

    - A string specifies one or more constraints each with zero or more
      arguments.
    - A keyword specifies a single constraint without arguments
    - A vector specifies a single constraint with one or more arguments
    - A map specifies one or more constraints as keys, each mapped to a
      single argument"
