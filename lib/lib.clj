;;  File: lib.clj
;;
;;  lib.clj provides facilities for loading and managing libs. A lib is a
;;  unit of Clojure code contained in a file or other resource within
;;  classpath. Lib names must be valid Clojure symbol names. The name of a
;;  lib's container is the lib name followed by ".clj". lib.clj also
;;  provides general functions for finding and loading resources using the
;;  class loaders visible to the Clojure runtime.
;;
;;  Here is a brief overview of what's in lib.clj. For detailed docs please
;;  see the doc strings for the individual functions and macros.
;;
;;  Resources
;;
;;    Function: find-resource
;;    Searches available class loaders for a resource, returns URL or nil
;;
;;    Function: load-resource
;;    Loads Clojure source from an absolute path: URI, URL or String
;;
;;  Core
;;
;;    Function: load-libs
;;    Loads lib(s) based libspecs and flags
;;
;;    Function: libs
;;    Returns a sorted set of symbols naming the currently loaded libs
;;
;;  Convenience
;;
;;    Macro: require
;;    Loads libs. By default doesn't reload any that are already loaded
;;
;;    Macro: use
;;    Loads libs like require and refers to each lib's namespace
;;
;;  Examples
;;
;;    (load-libs :require 'sql '(sql-test :in "private/unit-tests"))
;;    (require sql (sql-test :in "private/unit-tests"))
;;
;;    (load-libs :require :use 'sql 'ns-utils :verbose)
;;    (use sql ns-utils :verbose)
;;
;;    (use :reload-all :verbose
;;      (sql :exclude '(get-connection)
;;           :rename '{execute-commands do-commands})
;;      ns-utils)
;;
;;    (use (sql))
;;
;;    (load-libs :require :use '(genclass :ns 'clojure))

(defn load-libs
  "Searches classpath for libs and loads them. 'load-libs' accepts zero or
  more arguments where each argument is either a libspec that identifies a
  lib to load, or a flag that modifies how all the identified libs are
  loaded.

  A libspec is either a symbol or a list containing a symbol followed by
  zero or more options. Since the arguments to 'load-libs' are evaluated
  before the call, any literal libspecs passed in must be quoted.

  The 'require' and 'use' macros offer a simpler interface to the
  capabilities of load-libs and don't evaluate the libspecs they take as
  arguments.

  An option is a keyword followed by an argument.
  Recognized options: :in, :ns, :exclude, :only, :rename

  All arguments to options within libspecs are evaluated so literal lists
  and symbols appearing within libspecs must be quoted.

  The :in option's argument must evaluate to a string specifying the path
  of the lib's parent directory relative to a location in classpath.

  The :ns options's argument must evaluate to a symbol specifying the
  namespace to refer for this lib if the :use flag is present. When the
  :ns option is not present the namespace defaults to the one with the
  same name as the lib.

  The arguments and semantics for :exclude, :only, and :rename are those
  documented for clojure/refer.

  A flag is a keyword.
  Recognized flags: :require, :use, :reload, :reload-all, :verbose

  :require indicates that any identified libs that are already loaded need
    not be reloaded
  :use triggers referring to each lib's namespace after loading
  :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they were
    loaded previously. :reload supersedes :require
  :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the
    identified libs directly or indirectly load via load-libs/require/use
  :verbose triggers printing a message after loading each lib"
