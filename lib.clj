;;
;;  A 'lib' is a Clojure source file that follows these conventions:
;;
;;    - has a basename that is a valid symbol name in Clojure
;;    - has the extension ".clj"
;;
;;  A lib will typically also contain forms that provide something useful
;;  for a Clojure program to use.  It may also define a namespace with the
;;  same name as its basename.
;;
;;  This file is an example of a lib. It follows the naming conventions
;;  and provides these functions in the 'lib' namespace that make it
;;  convenient to use libs from Clojure source code and the Clojure repl:
;;
;;  'require'               searches classpath for libs and loads them if
;;                          they are not already loaded
;;
;;  'use'                   requires libs and refers to their namespaces
;;
;;  'libs'                  returns a sorted list of loaded libs
;;
;;  'load-uri'              loads Clojure source from a location
;;
;;  'load-system-resource'  loads Clojure source from a resource in
;;                          classpath
;;
;;  'require' and 'use' have additional options as described in their docs.
