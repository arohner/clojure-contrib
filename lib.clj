;;  File: lib.clj
;;
;;  lib.clj provides facilities for loading and managing libs. A lib is
;;  is a unit of Clojure code contained in a file or other resource within
;;  classpath. The name of the lib's container is the lib's name followed
;;  by ".clj". A lib's name must be a valid Clojure symbol name.  lib.clj
;;  also provides functions for finding and loading resources via class
;;  loaders visible to the Clojure runtime.
;;
;;  Resources
;;
;;  Function: find-resource
;;
;;  Searches available class loaders for a resource given its path relative
;;  to classpath. Returns a URL if the resource is found or nil.
;;
;;  Function: load-resource
;;
;;  loads Clojure source from an absolute path expressed as a URI, URL
;;  or String
;;
;;  Core
;;
;;  Function: load-libs
;;
;;  load-libs is the core function provided by lib.clj. Its arguments are
;;  libspecs and flags. It uses libspecs to find lib containers and flags
;;  to control how the libs are loaded. In an explicit call to load-libs
;;  libspecs must be quoted. This requirement is relaxed by the 'require'
;;  and 'use' macros described below.
;;
;;  Libspecs
;;
;;  A libspec is either a lib name or a list beginning with the lib name
;;  and followed by zero or more options.
;;
;;  Options
;;
;;  Options in a libspec are keywords followed by values. These are the
;;  options supported by load-libs and the kind of value each expects:
;;
;;    :in          a string specifying the path to the parent directory
;;                 of the lib's container relative to one of the
;;                 directories in classpath
;;    :ns          a symbol specifying a namespace for the lib. If :ns
;;                 is not present, its value defaults to the lib's name.
;;                 See the :use flag below.
;;    :exclude     a list as documented for clojure/refer
;;    :only        a list as documented for clojure/refer
;;    :rename      a map as documented for clojure/refer
;;
;;  Flags
;;
;;  Flags apply to all the libs specified in a single call to load-libs.
;;  These are the flags supported by load-libs:
;;
;;  :require       indicates that already loaded libs need not be reloaded
;;  :use           triggers a call to clojure/refer for each lib's namespace
;;                 after ensuring the lib is loaded. The call to refer
;;                 includes any filter options in the libspec.
;;  :reload        forces reloading of libs that are already loaded
;;  :reload-all    implies :reload and also forces reloading of all libs
;;                 on which each lib directly or indirectly depends
;;  :verbose       triggers printing a message each time a lib is loaded
;;
;;  (The :reload and :reload-all flags supersede :require.)
;;
;;  Function: libs
;;
;;  The libs function returns a sorted set of symbols naming the currently
;;  loaded libs.
;;
;;  Convenience
;;
;;  lib.clj provides two convenience macros to make calls to load-libs
;;  easier to write and read. Libspecs in calls to these macros do not
;;  need to be quoted.
;;
;;  Macro: require
;;
;;  The require macro accepts libspecs and flags and ensures that the
;;  specified libs are loaded. By default, require will not reload a lib
;;  that is already loaded.
;;
;;  Macro: use
;;
;;  The use macro accepts libspecs and flags and first requires the libs
;;  and then refers to each lib's namespace using any filter options present
;;  in its libspec.
;;
;;  Examples
;;
;;  (load-libs :require 'sql '(test :in "private/resources"))
;;  (require sql (test :in "private/resources"))
;;
;;  (load-libs :require :use 'sql 'ns-utils :verbose)
;;  (use sql ns-utils :verbose)
;;
;;  (use :reload-all :verbose
;;    (sql :exclude (get-connection) :rename {execute-commands do-commands})
;;    ns-utils)
;;  (use (sql))
;;
;;  (use (genclass :ns clojure))
