;;  lib.clj
;;
;;  A 'lib' is a unit of Clojure code contained in a file that follows
;;  these conventions:
;;
;;    - has a basename that is a valid symbol name in Clojure
;;    - has the extension ".clj"
;;
;;  A lib's name is the basename of its implementation file.
;;
;;  A lib will typically contain forms that provide something useful for
;;  a Clojure program to use.  It may also define a namespace which shares
;;  its name.
;;
;;  Libspecs
;;
;;  A lib is specified by a libspec which is either a lib name or a seq
;;  beginning with a lib name and followed by zero or more options
;;  expressed as sequential keywords and values. The options may include
;;  any of the filters documented for clojure/refer or the :in option which
;;  specifies the path to the lib's parent directory relative to one of the
;;  classpath roots.
;;
;;  Flags
;;
;;  Several flags are available to control the loading of libs:
;;
;;  :require       indicates that already loaded libs need not be reloaded
;;  :use           triggers a call to clojure/refer for each lib's namespace
;;                 after ensuring the lib is loaded
;;  :reload        forces reloading of libs that are already loaded
;;  :reload-all    implies :reload and also forces reloading of all libs
;;                 on which each lib directly or indirectly depends
;;  :verbose       triggers printing a message each time a lib is loaded
;;
;;  The :reload and :reload-all flags supersede :require.
;;
;;  Examples
;;
;;  (require sql)
;;  (require (test :in "private/resources"))
;;  (use sql ns-utils :verbose)
;;  (use :reload-all :verbose
;;    (sql :exclude (get-connection) :rename {execute-commands do-commands})
;;    ns-utils)
;;  (use (sql))
;;
;;  lib.clj provides the following functions and macros:
;;
;;  Foundation
;;
;;    'load-libs'             searches classpath for libs and loads them
;;                            based on libspecs and flags
;;
;;    'libs'                  returns a sorted sequence of symbols naming
;;                            loaded libs
;;
;;  Dependency Management
;;
;;    'require'               searches classpath for libs and loads them
;;                            if they are not already loaded (macro)
;;
;;    'use'                   requires libs and refers to their namespaces
;;                            with options (macro)
;;
;;  Loading
;;
;;    'load-uri'              loads Clojure source from a location
;;
;;    'load-system-resource'  loads Clojure source from a resource in
;;                            classpath
