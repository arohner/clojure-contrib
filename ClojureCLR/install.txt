Installing Clojure/CLR:

At present, this is a developer-only distribution.  Roll up your sleeves.


Platform:
---------

Microsoft .NET Framework Version 3.5 SP1
Visual Studio 2008 SP1
	I have not tested this under any other versions.  
	You are on your own if you go another way.


Visual J# Redistributable 
	Need vjslib to provide BigInteger and BigDecimal.

Unit testing:
-------------
Unit tests are built on NUnit and RhinoMocks.

Download NUnit from http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=download

I also recommend some type of VS plug-in for running NUnit.
I'm currently using http://www.testdriven.net/download.aspx


Download RhinoMocks from http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx
Get Version 3.5.  You will probably need the one that includes the Castle assemblies.

Mocking is used sparingly.  I'll take suggestions for better mocking solutions.



Dynamic Language Runtime:
-------------------------

You will need to download the DLR.  I try to keep the ClojureCLR code up to the latest DLR release.
See versions.txt for the most recent DLR release known to work.

The main page for DLR is http://www.codeplex.com/dlr
The latest source is at http://www.codeplex.com/dlr/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx

Download, unzip, compile it in VS.


Clojure/CLR
-----------

Download the code from the clojure-contrib distribution: http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/ClojureCLR
The most up-to-date version will be at github/TBD.

Being a developer's release, DLR dlls are not distributed.  Instead, it is expected you will link in the DLR project.  
You will need only the Microsoft.Scripting.Core, Microsoft.Scripting and Microsoft.Scripting.ExtensionAttribute projects.
(I link in the whole solution to simplify browsing IronPython and IronRuby code for inspiration.)
You are responsible for clearing out the links to my install of DLR and putting in your own.  

You will need to make sure Clojure/CLR projects have the proper references:

Clojure:  
	Microsoft.Scripting.Core
	Microsoft.Scripting
	Microsoft.Scripting.ExtensionAttribute 
	vjslib

Clojure.Console
	Clojure
	Microsoft.Scripting.Core
	Microsoft.Scripting
	Microsoft.Scripting.ExtensionAttribute 	

Clojure.Tests
	Clojure
	vjslib
	nunit.framework
	Castle.Core
	Castle.DynamicProxy2
	Rhino.Mocks

After that, you should be good to go.
