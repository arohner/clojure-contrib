ClojureCLR

This project is a native implementation of Clojure over the Microsoft .Net Framework 
programmed in C# and using the Dynamic Language Runtime.

Goals:

 -- Implement a feature-complete Clojure on top of CLR/DLR.
 -- Stay as close as possible to the JVM implementation.
      --- To the extent possible, use exactly the same boostrap *.clj files
          to define the environment.
      --- Match public interfaces and important data structure classes
 -- Try to use some of the more advanced features of the DLR, 
      where it makes sense to do so.
 -- Spawn a cottage industry of people making Visual Studio extensions
      for Clojure. :)
 -- Have fun.
